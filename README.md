# 🏥 Test Utilization & Patient Insights Dashboard

This interactive Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of patient testing behaviors, return visits, and test utilization patterns in a biomedical facility. It is designed to help healthcare administrators and analysts identify trends, improve operational efficiency, and optimize patient engagement.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Analyze the distribution of test types requested by patients.
- Compare new vs. returning patient behaviors over time.
- Track peak and off-peak hours for patient visits.
- Monitor financial performance (test revenue) and utilization rates.

---

## 📊 Key Metrics & Insights

- **109** total patients were served within the period.
- **40** of these were **returning patients**, representing **36.7%**.
- The total number of visits reached **155**, with a cumulative revenue of **GHS 23K**.
- **Allergy Panel**, **Blood Culture** and **COVID 19** tests were among the least frequently requested.
- Peak-hour visits accounted for **52.2%** of all visits, while **47.7%** occurred during off-peak times.
- Patient return trends showed a gradual increase from January to March, followed by a drop in April and October.
- A clear distinction was observed between **new** and **returning** patient visits, highlighting patient retention opportunities.

## 🧠 Recommendations

- 🎯 **Patient Retention Strategy**: Implement follow-up communications and loyalty programs to increase the return rate, especially after March where a drop is observed.
- 🕒 **Optimize Staffing for Peak Hours**: With a majority of visits during peak periods, allocate more staff during these times to reduce wait time and improve service quality.
- 💡 **Promote Underserved Test Types**: Consider promotional or awareness campaigns for underutilized tests like **Blood Culture** to drive utilization.
- 📅 **Analyze April & October Drop-offs**: Investigate possible causes for reduced visits during these months (e.g., seasonality, policy changes).
- 💵 **Revenue Diversification**: Explore bundling tests or value packages to enhance total revenue per visit.
- 📈 **Monitor Trends Continuously**: Set up alerts or monthly reviews to catch sharp fluctuations in returning patients or underused tests.
